# NetLogo test extension

This package contains the NetLogo test extension, which lets you define and run unit tests for NetLogo code.

## Using

TODO

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to point to your NetLogo directory (containing NetLogo.jar) and SCALA_HOME to point to your Scala 2.9.1 installation.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 SCALA_HOME=/usr/local/scala-2.9.1.final make

If compilation succeeds, `test.jar` will be created.
